				<p>Mend is a health app that aims to improve communication between patients with mental conditions and their therapist and health provider. Mend provides daily logs for the patient to record their mood, diary and a variety of measures to share with the therapist. The therapist can customize the content for the patient and utilize the data collected from the patient to better customize the therapy as well as discovering problems in an efficient manner.

				<p>I have a B.S. in psychology and worked 3 years at a psychology clinic as a project coordinator and clinical data coordinator. Through my experience with watching therapy sessions as well as the interaction between therapists and patients, I realized the lack of communication is a serious problem that prevents therapists effectively treating their patients. As individual therapy sessions are typically 1 hour each week, it is extremely hard for the therapist to get a comprehensive understanding of a week worth of their patient's life in such a short timeframe.<img id="pie_chart" src="img/pie_chart.png"/></p>
